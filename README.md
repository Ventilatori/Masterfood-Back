# Shop2Go Backend

Backend for Shop2Go, a food delivery site focused on providing an intuitive
way to search through both shops and items using a tag based system.
Frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/Ventilatori/Shop2Go-Front)

## Main Features

* Providing an easy interface for people to find shops and items that they want.
* Showing both customers and shop owners roughly how busy the shop using average
  orders per hour, as well as the overall average response time.
* Providing a list of nearby shops to incentivise users to order locally, 
  increasing both response times as well as customer satisfaction.
* Giving shop owners a way to categorize their items in a more natural way,
  rather than adhering to strict categories.
